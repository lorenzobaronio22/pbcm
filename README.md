Proxmox Backup Client Manager

## Project Goals

- Centralize management of home lab backups currently run individually on each system.
- Provide a dashboard for home lab users using Proxmox Backup Client, replacing manual or crontab-based management.
- Enable visualization of backup jobs, including status, logs, configuration, scheduling, manual execution, and alert notifications.
- Serve as a frontend for Proxmox Backup Client, with potential future support for backup restore.
- Achieve a level of functionality that allows me to fully manage my home lab backups and replace my current CTFreak setup.
